			<h2>About</h2>

			<h3>Small Beginnings</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Drawing, doodling, sketching, making a mess, whatever they called it, that&#39;s what I was doing. With a family background of artists and scientists, I was encouraged to follow whatever passion I had. I grew up loving the hard sciences in class, and would go home and test new recipes in my kitchen, drawing on whatever piece of paper that was laying around and finding new creative outlets everyday.</p>
				</blockquote>
			<h3>Choice of Major</h3>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I started in Criminal Justice at EWU, wanting to become a detective. I always loved figuring things out and how one piece of the puzzle fits in with the rest. However, I found that the field wasn&#39;t playing to all of my strengths and looked into other options. The VCD program was a perfect fit, playing to my need to make things look &quot;right&quot; and my creative tendencies.</p>
